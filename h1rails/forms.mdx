### Rails Form Helpers

Rails Form Helpers are one of the few times we recommend using an abstraction instead of just vanilla html `<form>` elements. This is because they provide substantial utility:

* **Security**: Every form includes and validates a CSRF protection.

* **Validation**: We can show inline errors and top-of-form errors in one line of code.

* **Templating**: We can use the same form template for edit and update and Rails will choose the right method.

* **Nested Forms**: We can easily build has\_many forms without creating a mess of frontend code.

### Form Styling

Form styling is powered by [Base Styles](/basestyles/intro). All we need to do is add a class of `.ui-form` to our form and all our form inputs will be styled for us. We can remove these default styles on a per field basis if we prefer - see instructions below.&#x20;

### Loading States

* Form loading states are handled by htmx - all we have to do is to is add a loading spinner which is hidden by default. You can read more in our article on [HTMX Indicators](/h1rails/htmx_indicators).



# Code Examples

### Simple Form

<CodeGroup>
  ```ruby routes.rb
  match "/books/:id" => "books#edit", via: [:get,:patch], as: "book"
  ```

  ```ruby books_controller.rb
  def edit
    if request.post?
      if @book.update(book_params)
        redirect_to root_path
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  ```erb edit.html.erb
  <%= form_with model: @book, url: book_path, html: {class:"ui-form"} do |f| %>
    <%= f.text_field :title, placeholder: "Title" %>
    <%= f.button class: "ui-button --solid" do |button| %>
      Save  
      <%= inline_svg_tag("heroicons/check.svg") %>
      <%= inline_svg_tag("misc/spinner.svg",class:"shown-while-loading") %>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
  ```

  ```
  console.log("Hello World");
  ```
